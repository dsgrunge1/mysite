<p>Without a program, new employees will make mistakes while in their learning
curve that will require assistance and intervention from other team

<p>We need to find the bad processes, not bad people, and remedy them
accordingly. The act of reflecting on your just-finished project is not
naturally a high priority.</p>
<p>While <strong>safety</strong> is ultimately the responsibility of <strong>all the participants</strong>
in a retrospective, the facilitator needs to initiate, monitor and
control the safety. Part of being safe means knowing that there will be
no retribution for being honest. Trust must be established and maintained
during a retrospective.</p>
<p>Managers must participate, contribute and learn rather than dominate
the discussions.</p>
<p>A retrospective can turn into complaint session rather than learning
session and, by virtue of that, the information is necessarily highly
regarded.</p>

<li>&quot;Create safety&quot; - establish rules: no interrupt, don&#x27;t judge, own
perspective, no jokes</li>
<li>&quot;Artifacts contest&quot; - bring your artifacts: coding standards,
documents, mockups, notes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Middle</strong></p>

<li>
<p>&quot;Develop a timeline&quot; - activity cards</p>

<ul>
<li>sitting</li>
<li>no natural light</li>
<li>
<p>time-boxed - <em>&quot;C&#x27;mon be creative, you have 30 minutes&quot;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>5-member team meeting takes at least 30 minutes = 5 * 5 minutes per person + 5 min intro</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>struggle to remember</li>
<li>focus on action items - <em>&quot;Typical sunny day thinking&quot;</em></li>

<h3 id="learn-from-each-other"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#learn-from-each-other"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Learn from each other</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer this methodology in the beginning when the team members
don&#x27;t know each other well and the process of learning is in full sail.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;What have you learned this iteration that we could benefit from immediately?&quot;</em></li>
<li>Each team member gets 5 minutes speech.</li>
<li>No interruptions during the speeches.</li>
<li>Take feedback in good faith.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Technique developed by Taiichi Ohno the father of the Toyota Production System.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the root of every seemingly <em>technical problem</em> is a <em>human problem</em>. Five Whys provides an opportunity
to discover what that human problem might be.</p>
<p>The root cause moves away from a technical fault and toward a human error and we can trace these
problems back to <strong>training</strong> or <strong>company manual</strong> or <strong>documentation</strong>.</p>
<p>Some basic rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>for each of the 5 questions asked, appoint a person in charge with the improvement (the answer)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-feedback"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#getting-feedback"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Getting feedback</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Though this is a more formal approach to retrospective, it can trigger
innovation by acknowledging the goals and sponsoring them.</p>

When someone is asked to give feedback on a colleague, make them remember the last incidents and how they responded.</p></div></article></div><footer><p>[<a href="/">Back to Home</a>]</p></footer></div></div><script id="PhenomicHydration" type="text/json">{"path=wiki&id=retrospectives":{"status":"idle","node":{"filename":"index.md","title":"On Retrospectives","description":"My thoughts on software team retrospectives.","date":"2015-11-01","body":{"t":"div","c":[{"t":"blockquote","c":["\n",{"t":"p","c":["Without a program, new employees will make mistakes while in their learning\ncurve that will require assistance and intervention from other team\nmembers, slowing everyone down.
